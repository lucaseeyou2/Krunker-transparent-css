# Krunker-transparent-css
This transparent css works for the client version of [Krunker.io](https://krunker.io/) or also in a browser (chrome, edge, firefox) with the [krunker ressource swapper](https://github.com/Tehchy/Krunker-Resource-Swapper) by Techy. See the steps on his README and add the following ressources : main_custom.css and social_custom.css. Also, this code won't work (or won't work proprely) on the MTZ client and other clients. Precision : the font for the following css is [popins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) Semi-bold 600. **Currently, the css is in work and may be some changes in the near future**.

## Changes
v1 Setting up the README.md and main.css.\
v2 Adding social.custom.css, renamed main.css to main_custom.css and updating README.md.\
