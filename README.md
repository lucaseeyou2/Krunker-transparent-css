# Krunker.io transparent CSS
This transparent CSS works for the client version of [Krunker.io](https://krunker.io/) or also in a browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) with the [Krunker-Resource-Swapper](https://github.com/Tehchy/Krunker-Resource-Swapper) by Techy. See the steps on his README and add the following resources: main_custom.css, social_custom.css, and the fonts (optional). Also, this code won't work (or doesn't work properly) on the MTZ client and other clients, in reason of their different structures. Precision: the font for the following CSS is [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) **Semi-bold 600**. Don't change the names of the files or the CSS won't work.

## Usage
