# Krunker-transparent-css
This transparent css works for the client version of [Krunker.io](https://krunker.io/) or also in a browser (chrome, edge, firefox) with the [krunker ressource swapper](https://github.com/Tehchy/Krunker-Resource-Swapper) by Techy. See the steps on the README of that page and add the following ressources : main_custom.css and social_custom.css. Also, this code won't work (won't work proprely) on the MTZ client and others. **Currently, the css is in work and may be some changes in the near future**.

## Changes
v1 Setting up the README.md and main.css.  
v2 Adding social.custom.css, renamed main.css to main_custom.css and updating README.md.
