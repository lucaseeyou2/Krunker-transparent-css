# Krunker-transparent-css
This transparent css works for the client version of krunker or also the [krunker ressource swapper](https://github.com/Tehchy/Krunker-Resource-Swapper) by Techy. See the steps and the the css inside the ressources that you want to add. Also, this code won't work on the MTZ client. **Currently, the css is in work and may be some changes in the near future**.
